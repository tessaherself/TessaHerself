# 👋 Hey, I’m Tessa

Welcome to my corner of GitHub
Most of my work happens in my full time job...
things like CRMs, data pipelines, Airflow orchestration, vector search, and internal web apps.  
So this space looks emptier than it should 😅

## 💡 What I’ve been working on (mostly at work)
- Building and scaling **data systems** — from ETL pipelines to sync engines  
- Working deeply with **MongoDB**, **indexing**, and **vector search**
- Automating everything around **Airflow**, **CI/CD**, and **infrastructure**
- Creating **internal tools** and **AI-driven web apps**, like **Rex** (a file chunking & preprocessing platform)
- Exploring **Flowwise**, smaller **data science projects**, and **custom CRM** tooling

## 💖 What I’ve loved learning
- **Object-oriented programming** and clean architecture in **Python**  
- **Pydantic** (probably too much)  
- **API design**, **async I/O**, and **FastAPI**  
- Understanding how databases and data pipelines really work under the hood

## 🌱 What I’m learning next
- **Kubernetes** — really understanding it, not just deploying on it  
- **Neo4j** & graph databases (maybe “GraphRex” someday?)  
- Building useful **AI companions** — for example, tools that could live in your workflow,  
  auto-navigate Jira or Atlassian, or continuously run market research in the background

## 🧩 Older public things
I keep a few older projects here — like **Pixtures**, which turns Google Maps areas block-by-block  
into artistic patterns inspired by **Ed Fairburn**’s map portraits;  
**solarsystem**, a physics-based simulation engine for gravitational systems;  
and my first **freelance CRM**.  
They’re not perfect, but I keep them around as milestones 🌍
